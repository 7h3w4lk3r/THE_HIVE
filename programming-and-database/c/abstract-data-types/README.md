it gives an implementation-independent view to process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.

#### to create an ATD you have to: 

1. provide an abstract description of the types properties and of the operations you can perform on the type. 

2. develop a programming interface that implements the ADT 

3. write code to implement the interface
