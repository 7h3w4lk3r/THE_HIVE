  need to know before diving into reversing and exploit development.

# C

#### C might sound a bit old when it comes to the new era of coding and software development specially when the social media and software companies are filled with web developers/designers, AI and ML folks and so-called data scientists. but when it comes to software security, reversing and exploit development, C is the first language to know because its the only low-level language with a high-level syntax and teaches you everything you need to know about how computers work and how you can manage and manipulate memory. for windows reversing you will probably face C++ apps more but we start with Linux because it always makes things easier for beginners.

#### Here i try to make a simple and useful tutorial about C, for C++ i will only talk about the differences and OOP because C and C++ have the same concepts, except for a few things the basics are pretty much the same in both of these and i highly recommend you start with C before moving to c++ or Java. this way you fully understand the concepts of  program execution and how the whole system works which will definitely help you later.
